# Element++

>Currently under heavy development

This is a GUI library written in modern C++ (11/14). 
It is cross-platform and was designed as a simple embeddable user interface library for applications. It can also be used to build fullblown UI applications.
Element++ practices a **declarative** functional reactive code pattern making it very easy to quickly write up some nice user interfaces.

## Features

- Declarative syntax
- Modern C++
- Easy to learn and use
- Fully skinnable
- Custom widgets
- Unicode support
- Easy to embed into applications with an already established *main loop*
